                        <p class="card-text">Putters are the slowest flying disc golf discs. They are usually easy
                            to control and won’t go too far. Compared with drivers, putters almost always fly very
                            straight. They are good not just for landing in the basket, but also for approach shots–
                            landing close to the basket to set up easy putts. If you’re looking for a disc that will
                            fly straight without a big end of flight fade, you may want to consider throwing a
                            putter.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Midrange discs are slower flying and have rounded, less aerodynamic
                            edges. Some midrange discs can fly almost perfectly straight. Like fairway drivers, many
                            midrange discs are just older discs that used to be considered distance drivers.
                            Midrange discs are designed to give maximum control and accuracy without sailing past
                            the target. It’s not uncommon for experienced disc golfers to tee off with midrange
                            drivers, or even putters.</p>

                            distance drivers potentially can. In general, fairway drivers have thinner rims, are
                            more stable, can fly straighter, and are easier to control. Many of the discs currently
                            classified as “fairway drivers” are the power discs of the past. As disc golf technology
                            and innovation continues to improve, the distance these older discs can fly is less
                            impressive. With that said, for beginning disc golfers, fairway drivers will usually
                            perform better than the max distance drivers.
