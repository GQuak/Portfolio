# Gabe Quakkelaar's Portfolio
Homework Assignment 08: Professional Materials

DESCRIPTION
This is my professional portfolio which includes my resume, personal experiences, and linked professional projects. 

I refactored a previous project that I had created to be a multipaged website built on a mobile-first design. I still have not included the required code to enable the contact information collection, but I will continue to update this project. I utilized mainly HTML & CSS to create the webpages and am incorporating Javascript elements to increase the dynamic aspects of the webpages.
