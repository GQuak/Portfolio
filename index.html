                        <h5>Our Founder</h5>
                        <p class="founder">Gabe Quakkelaar started playing disc golf in 2017 when his college roommate
                            took
                            him out between Ultimate frisbee practices and games. After graduating from college in the
                            spring of 2018 with a double major in Business Management and Computer Information systems
                            he
                            continued to play casually as a way to get outside and to keep in touch with college
                            friends.
                            Eventually he started to take the sport more seriously and played a few tournaments and
                            started
                            watching professional footage on YouTube, which inspired him to work on his game and to
                            connect
                            with the Disc Golf community. Once he created an Instagram account, he quickly realized that
                            he
                            had a unique blend of talent and experience that would allow him to create a successful Disc
                            Golf brand that provides unique data analysis on the professional scene. Now he’s living
                            outside
                            Denver, Colorado with his wife and Australian Shepherd taking the University of Denver
                            coding
                            bootcamp so he can improve this website and make the data analysis even more easily
                            accessible
                            for other fans.</p>

                        <h5>History</h5>
                        <p class="history">GQ Disc Golf was founded in December 2019 when Gabe Quakkelaar created an
                            Instagram account to share his Disc Golf adventure. Since then, the brand has grown to over
                            1.3k
                            Instagram followers, over 500 likes on Facebook, and 130+ followers on Twitter. In 2021 the
                            brand
                            is growing by actively promoting the YouTube channel by posting content more regularly and
                            promoting it across all of their social platforms. Another big step is the creation of a
                            website
                            where unique statistical analysis can be shared in an informative and interactive way.</p>

                        <h5>Mission</h5>
                        <p class="mission">“To promote Disc Golf by creating a positive environment on social media,
                            helping

                            statistical
