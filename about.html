                    <h5>Our Founder</h5>
                    <p class="founder">Gabe Quakkelaar started playing disc golf in 2017 when his college roommate took
                        him out between Ultimate frisbee practices and games. After graduating from college in the
                        spring of 2018 with a double major in Business Management and Computer Information systems he
                        continued to play casually as a way to get outside and to keep in touch with college friends.
                        Eventually he started to take the sport more seriously and played a few tournaments and started
                        watching professional footage on YouTube, which inspired him to work on his game and to connect
                        with the Disc Golf community. Once he created an Instagram account, he quickly realized that he
                        had a unique blend of talent and experience that would allow him to create a successful Disc
                        Golf brand that provides unique data analysis on the professional scene. Now he’s living outside
                        Denver, Colorado with his wife and Australian Shepherd taking the University of Denver coding
                        bootcamp so he can improve this website and make the data analysis even more easily accessible
                        for other fans.</p>

                    <h5>History</h5>
                    <p class="history">GQ Disc Golf was founded in December 2019 when Gabe Quakkelaar created an
                        Instagram account to share his Disc Golf adventure. Since then, the brand has grown to over 1.3k
                        Instagram followers, over 500 likes on Facebook, and 130+ followers on Twitter. In 2021 the
                        brand
                        is growing by actively promoting the YouTube channel by posting content more regularly and
                        promoting it across all of their social platforms. Another big step is the creation of a website
                        where unique statistical analysis can be shared in an informative and interactive way.</p>

                    <h5>Mission</h5>
                    <p class="mission">“To promote Disc Golf by creating a positive environment on social media, helping
                        new players learn more about the game and the professional level, and provide unique statistical
                        insights.”</p>
